##Goal

Use CheapShark to find out game information such as where it's available to buy, and the cheapest price(in usd) 

Use Giant Bomb to find out the game's reviews, release date, the game's rating, and check for any promotional material for the game.




###Future possibilities
Have the user be able to interact with Cheapshark
Have Cheapshark relay information on the game's id/title, then send it to Giant Bomb which will list reviews, rating, promos, release date etc.
